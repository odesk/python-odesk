Changelog

.. _0.5.2:

Version 0.5.2
-------------
* Fixed engagements API call, so that you can call
  ``client.hr.get_engagements()`` without any parameter
  to get all engagements for authorized user.
* oTask API strongly reworked, from now Task Codes are
  renamed to Activities and it's behavior is changed:
    1. Activity now is assigned to the engagement ID.
       It will appear it user's oDesk Team Client only if
       it was assigned to the user's engagement.
    2. You cannot delete activity. You can archive it
       and unarchive if necessary.
    3. Activities are created on the team level,
       you can create a company level activities by
       passing ``team_id`` that is equal to ``company_id``
       (which is ``parent__team_id``). There's a methods
       for this already, please see the reference documentation.
       Note that archived activity has empty engagements list,
       so if you decide to unarchive an activity, you need to
       do an extra update call to assign the activity to someone.
    4. When creating/updating activities you can pass optional
       ``engagements`` parameter, that should be a list of engagements
       that will be assigned to the Activity. Otherwise the activity
       won't be assigned to anyone. If you want to assign created/updated
       activity to all engagements in the company, you can set
       the ``all_in_company`` parameter.
    5. ``update_batch_tasks`` call is marked as experimental,
       use it on your own risk. It will be reworked in future.

.. _0.5.1:

Version 0.5.1
-------------
* Fixed bug preventing update (``PUT`` method) for oTask codes that
  contained non-urlsafe characters, e.g. "space", "colon", etc.

.. _0.5:

Version 0.5
-----------------
*October 2013*

Backwards incompatibility changes:

* Old key-based authorization is completely removed, now the only way
  to authorize is oAuth 1.0
* ``odesk.Client`` class doesn't support ``auth`` keyword argument any more,
  as now there's only one way of doing authorization
* Introduced V2 API calls for
  :py:meth:`Search Providers<odesk.routers.provider.Provider_V2.search_providers>` and
  :py:meth:`Search Jobs<odesk.routers.provider.Provider_V2.search_jobs>`.
  V1 API calls still work but to the end of 2013 will be switched off.
  So we greatly encourage you to use V2 API calls.
* ``examples/`` directory of the repository is updated with new examples for
  web and desktop application

Improvements:

* Clean up API to be consistent with official oDesk API documentation
* Now we use ``urllib3`` and all Http exceptions returned by API have
  meaningful messages
* Real PUT and DELETE json calls
* Some parts of API are fixed with to work correctly. Please refer to the
  method's docstring to see comprehensive description

*Nov 2012*

* Add Metadata Api
* Fixed job posting issue
* Add advanced logging
